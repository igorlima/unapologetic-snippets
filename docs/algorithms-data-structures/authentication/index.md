# Authentication

## JWT [^1]

JWT authentication and session authentication are ways to authenticate users of your web app.

JWT stands for JSON Web Token, and it is a commonly used stateless user authentication standard used to securely transmit information between client and server in a JSON format.

A JWT is encoded by default, not encrypted. It is digitally signed with a secret key that only the server knows. Additionally, it has the capability to be encrypted.

### Structure of JWT [^1]

A JSON Web Token consists of 3 parts separated by a period.
The header, the payload, and the signature.
Each section is base64 encoded.

__Header__

The header consists of token type, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

```json
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "HS256"
}
```

__Payload__

A payload carries claims, which are statements about the user along with additional data. These claims typically include the time the token was issued (`iat`) and its expiration time (`exp`), as tokens should have a limited lifespan.

```json
{
  "iss": "example_issuer",
  "sub": "user_id123",
  "exp": 1644768000,
  "iat": 1644744000
}
```

__Signature__

The signature is most important part of a JWT.

It is calculated using the header, the payload, and the secret, which are fed to the signing algorithm to use.

```plaintext
signature = HMAC-SHA256(base64urlEncode(header) + "." + base64urlEncode(payload), secret_salt)
```
