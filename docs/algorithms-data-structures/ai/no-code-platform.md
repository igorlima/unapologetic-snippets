## "No-Code is the New Technical Debt"

As AI assists in every level of operations, parts of your business hidden behind other people's abstractions become blind spots. The more layers you rent from vendors, the more of your business you lose control over.

So now, rather than merely celebrating that you have built something, you have to shift your thinking. What matters now is not just whether you can build something quickly, but whether you own what you build–whether you can adapt it, extend it, understand it deeply enough to change its structure as your business changes.

**No-code platforms** hide complexity instead of solving it [^1] [^2]. They give you the ability to move quickly at first, but only by borrowing against your future flexibility.

Every workflow built on no-code becomes harder to change over time, not easier, because the real workings of the system are abstracted away behind proprietary layers you don’t control.

The missing flexibility, the hidden complexity, the inability to adapt quickly without going back to the vendor–all of these become a kind of technical debt. And like all technical debt, it grows silently until it demands repayment at exactly the worst possible time.

The parts of your business that are hidden behind other people’s abstractions become blind spots. The more layers you rent from vendors, the more of your business you lose control over.
