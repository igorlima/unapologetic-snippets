    Vim has some special marks which it sets automatically. Here are some of the most useful:
     
    | Mark       | Description                                                   |
    | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `` `. ``   | jump to position where last change occurred in current buffer |
    | `` `" ``   | jump to position where last exited current buffer             |
    | `` `0 ``   | jump to position in last file edited (when exited Vim)        |
    | `` `1 ``   | like `` `0 `` but the previous file (also  `` `2 `` etc)      |
    | `` '' ``   | jump back (to line in current buffer where jumped from)       |
    | `` ` ` ``  | jump back (to position in current buffer where jumped from)   |
    | `` `[ ``   | jump to beginning of previously changed or yanked text        |
    | `` `] ``   | jump to end of previously changed or yanked text              |
    | `` `< ``   | jump to beginning of last visual selection                    |
    | `` `> ``   | jump to end of last visual selection                          |

  - <details markdown="block"><summary><strong>save</strong> and <strong>store</strong> mark position</summary>
     
    You can **save and restore** the position of a mark in Vim with the following snippet:
    <a id="how-to-save-restore-vim-mark-position"></a>
     
    ```vim
    let save_a_mark = getpos("'a")
    call setpos("'a", save_a_mark)
    :help '<
    ```
     
    Just a heads-up: for Visual mode, the behavior of `'<` and `'>` changes depending on the mode. In visual line mode (V), the column of `'<` is zero, and the column of `'>` is a large number equal to `v:maxcol`.
     
    Here's a quick rundown of the marks <sup>[+](https://vimhelp.org/builtin.txt.html)</sup>:
    - `'<`: Points to the first line or character of the last selected Visual area in the current buffer. In block mode, it may also be the last character in the first line to define the block.
    - `'>`: Points to the last line or character of the last selected Visual area in the current buffer. In block mode, it may also be the first character of the last line to define the block. Note that 'selection' applies, so the position may be just after the Visual area.

  - <details markdown="block"><summary>replacing in multiple files</summary>
     
    **Example Workflow:**
     
    Here's a concise example of the entire process:
     
    ```vim
    :grep foo **/*.js      " Search for 'foo' in JavaScript files
    :cdo s/foo/bar/gc      " Line-wise replace 'foo' with 'bar' (with confirmation)
    :cfdo %s/foo/bar/gc    " File-wise replace 'foo' with 'bar' (with confirmation)
    :cfdo up               " Save changes
    ```
     
    This guide provides a friendly walkthrough for performing powerful search and replace operations across multiple files in Vim.  We'll break down the process into smaller, manageable steps.
     
    1. <details markdown="block"><summary>populating the Quickfix list:</summary>
        
       The first step is to identify all occurrences of your search pattern.  Several commands can achieve this by populating Vim's "quickfix list." Here are a few options:
        
       * **`:grep`:**  A built-in command for searching.  For example, to search for "foo" in all JavaScript files within the current directory and its subdirectories, use:
        
          ```vim
          :grep foo **/*.js
          ```
        
       * **`:vimgrep`:** Similar to `:grep`, but offers more advanced pattern matching capabilities.
        
       You can view the quickfix list with `:cwindow`.
       </details>
       
    2. <details markdown="block"><summary>performing the replacement:</summary>
        
       Once the quickfix list is populated, you can perform the replacement using either `:cdo` (operate on each line in the quickfix list) or `:cfdo` (operate on each file containing matches).
        
       * **`:cdo` (Line-wise Replacement):**
        
          ```vim
          :cdo s/foo/bar/gc
          ```
          This replaces "foo" with "bar" on each line listed in the quickfix list, prompting for confirmation (`c`) before each substitution.
        
       * **`:cfdo` (File-wise Replacement):**
        
          ```vim
          :cfdo %s/foo/bar/gc
          ```
          This replaces all instances of "foo" with "bar" within each *file* listed in the quickfix list, also prompting for confirmation (`c`) before each substitution.  The `%` ensures the substitution applies to the entire file.
        
       * **Skipping Confirmation:**  If you're confident in your replacement, you can omit the `c` flag for automatic substitution. See `:help :s_flags` for more details on substitution flags.
       </details>
     
    3. <details markdown="block"><summary>saving changes:</summary>
        
       After performing the replacements, save the changes to disk using `:cfdo update` (or its abbreviated form, `:cfdo up`):
        
       ```vim
       :cfdo update
       ```
       This command writes only the modified files to disk.
        
       </details>
        
    - <details markdown="block"><summary>deleting lines with <code>:global</code>:</summary>
       
      You can also use the quickfix list to delete lines matching a pattern.  For example, to delete all lines containing "my-grep-pattern" within the files in the quickfix list:
       
      ```vim
      :cfdo %g/my-grep-pattern/d
      ```
